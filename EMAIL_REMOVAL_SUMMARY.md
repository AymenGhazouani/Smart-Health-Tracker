# Email Integration Removal Summary

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **AppointmentController.php** - Removed Email/Notification Integration
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/AppointmentController.php`

**Removed:**
- ✅ Import statements for notification classes:
  - `use App\Notifications\AppointmentBooked;`
  - `use App\Notifications\AppointmentCanceled;`
  - `use App\Notifications\AppointmentRescheduled;`

- ✅ Notification calls in `store()` method:
  - Removed: `$provider->user->notify(new AppointmentBooked($appointment));`

- ✅ Notification calls in `update()` method:
  - Removed: `$appointment->provider->user->notify(new AppointmentRescheduled($appointment));`

- ✅ Notification calls in `cancel()` method:
  - Removed: `$appointment->provider->user->notify(new AppointmentCanceled($appointment));`

### 2. **Notification Classes** - Deleted Appointment-Related Files
**Files Deleted:**
- ✅ `app/Notifications/AppointmentBooked.php`
- ✅ `app/Notifications/AppointmentCanceled.php`
- ✅ `app/Notifications/AppointmentRescheduled.php`

### 3. **Mail Configuration** - Disabled Email Sending
**File:** `.env`

**Changed:**
- ✅ `MAIL_MAILER=smtp` → `MAIL_MAILER=log`
- ✅ `MAIL_HOST=mailpit` → `MAIL_HOST=127.0.0.1`
- ✅ `MAIL_PORT=1025` → `MAIL_PORT=2525`

**Result:** All emails will now be logged instead of sent, effectively disabling email functionality.

### 4. **ProviderController.php** - Fixed Route Issues
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/ProviderController.php`

**Fixed Route Redirects:**
- ✅ `store()` method: `admin.providers.index` → `providers.index`
- ✅ `update()` method: `admin.providers.index` → `providers.index`
- ✅ `destroy()` method: `admin.providers.index` → `providers.index`

## 🔍 **What Was NOT Removed**

The following were **intentionally kept** as they may be used for other features:

- ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/NotificationsController.php` - General notification management
- ✅ `app/Notifications/MetricsReminderNotification.php` - Health metrics reminders
- ✅ `database/migrations/2025_09_29_125909_create_notifications_table.php` - Notifications table
- ✅ Notification routes in `routes/web.php`
- ✅ Notification links in `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`
